## How to Use Discussions Properly

To keep discussions useful and organized:

- **Stage-specific questions** → Use the appropriate *Stage XX* category  
- **General technical questions** → Use *Q&A*  
- **Career advice and industry discussion** → Use *Career & Jobs*  
- **Projects and progress sharing** → Use *Show & Tell*  
- **Study collaboration** → Use *Study Groups*  
- **Suggestions and improvements** → Use *Feature Requests*  
- **Bugs or errors** → Check *Issues* first, then discuss if needed  

Posting in the correct category helps everyone get better answers faster.
