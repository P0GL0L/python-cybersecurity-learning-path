# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing.

## Ground Rules
- Keep changes focused and easy to review.
- Do not submit real secrets, credentials, API keys, or personal data.
- If you add code, add or update docs so learners can run it.

## Recommended Workflow
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch:
   - `git checkout -b feature/<short-name>`
3. Make changes with clear, scoped commits.
4. Run quick checks (if applicable):
   - `python --version`
   - `python -m compileall .`
5. Open a Pull Request with:
   - What changed
   - Why it changed
   - How to test it

## Style
- Prefer clarity over cleverness.
- Use descriptive names and short functions.
- Keep examples minimal and runnable.
