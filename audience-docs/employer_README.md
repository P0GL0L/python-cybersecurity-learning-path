# Python Cybersecurity Learning Path

This repository demonstrates a **progressive, real-world Python learning path** with an emphasis on **secure software development practices**, automation, testing, and disciplined workflow.

It is designed to show **how skills were built**, not just what code was written.

---

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Incremental skill development from fundamentals to a portfolio-ready CLI tool
- Secure coding habits applied from the beginning (input validation, error handling)
- Realistic command-line tooling patterns
- File handling, logging, and automation
- Safe interaction with external data and APIs
- Testing, packaging, and CI discipline
- Professional Git workflow and documentation standards

This repository is intentionally structured to mirror how skills are developed in professional environments.

## Portfolio Context

This repository is not a finished commercial product.

It is a **skills narrative** that shows:
- how problems were approached
- how reliability was improved over time
- how tooling was hardened and documented
- how workflow discipline was enforced

It is designed to support technical discussion in interviews or reviews.

---

## Status

All stages are complete, documented, and committed using a disciplined Git workflow.
