# Learner Overview  
Python Cybersecurity Learning Path

This document explains **how to use this repository effectively as a learner** and how to choose the right documentation based on your goals.

This repository is structured to help you **build skills progressively**, not rush to a final project.

---

## What This Repository Is

This repository is a **stage-based Python learning path** with a cybersecurity mindset.

You will:
- start with Python fundamentals
- build toward realistic command-line tools
- learn safe coding habits
- practice testing, packaging, and CI
- finish with a portfolio-ready project

Each stage builds directly on the last.

---

## How to Get Started

If this is your first time here:

1. Read `docs/START_HERE.md`
2. Review `docs/LEARNER_PROGRESS_CHECKLIST.md`
3. Begin with `stage-starters/stage_01`
4. Complete stages **in numerical order**
5. Commit and push after **every stage**

Skipping steps defeats the purpose of the learning path.

---

## How to Progress Through Stages

Each stage includes:
- a stage-specific `README.md`
- clear goals and acceptance criteria
- run instructions
- a Definition of Done
- a required commit and push

A stage is **not complete** until:
- the checklist items are met
- the README instructions are followed
- changes are committed and pushed
- `git status` shows a clean working tree

Treat each stage like a small deliverable, not practice code.

## Choosing the Right Documentation for Your Needs

This repository includes **audience-specific documentation** so you can tailor how you use or present the work.

### If you are learning:
- Follow `docs/START_HERE.md`
- Use `docs/LEARNER_PROGRESS_CHECKLIST.md`
- Read stage READMEs carefully

### If you are preparing for interviews:
- See `audience-docs/interview_talking_points.md`
- Practice explaining stages and decisions out loud

### If you are sharing with employers:
- Point reviewers to `audience-docs/employer_README.md`
- Use the repo as a discussion artifact, not a finished product

### If this is for academic evaluation:
- Refer instructors to `audience-docs/instructor_notes.md`
- Ensure all stages and documentation are complete

You do **not** need to use every document for every situation.

## How Much Time Should This Take?

This is **not** meant to be rushed.

Suggested pacing:
- Stages 01–02: fundamentals and confidence building
- Stages 03–04: applying skills to real problems
- Stage 05: slowing down to focus on quality
- Stage 06: integration and polish

Quality and understanding matter more than speed.

---

## What Success Looks Like

By the end of this repository, you should be able to:

- explain what each stage taught you
- run and explain your CLI tools
- describe how you handled errors and edge cases
- talk about testing and CI with confidence
- explain why documentation and Git discipline matter

If you can explain your decisions, you succeeded.

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Skipping READMEs
- Completing stages out of order
- Forgetting to commit and push
- Treating this like a one-time assignment
- Focusing on features instead of clarity

This repository rewards discipline and consistency.

## Final Note to Learners

This learning path is designed to help you **think like a professional**, not just write code.

Take your time.  
Ask “why,” not just “how.”  
Use the documentation as part of the learning.

When you’re done, this repository should tell a clear story — even if you’re not in the room to explain it.
