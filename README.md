# Python Cybersecurity Learning Path

A step-by-step Python learning path for cybersecurity, guiding beginners through secure software development, automation, logging, integrity checks, and a final capstone project.

This repository is designed for **learners**, **career-changers**, and **students** who want to learn Python with a real-world cybersecurity focus.

---

## What This Repository Is

- A **beginner-to-capstone Python learning path**
- Security concepts integrated from day one
- Hands-on projects instead of theory-only lessons
- Aligned to the **NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework**
- Built openly so others can learn, fork, and adapt

---

## Start Here

If you're new to this repository, start with the onboarding guide:

- **Start here:** `docs/START_HERE.md` — prerequisites, setup, how to run each stage, and the commit/push rules.

> Workflow rule: complete each stage, then **commit + push** before moving forward.
