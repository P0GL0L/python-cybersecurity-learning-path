# Quick Start – Python Cybersecurity Learning Path

This is the **fastest way to begin** using this repository.

If you only read one file before starting, read this one.

---

## 1) Prerequisites

- Python **3.10+** installed
- Git installed
- Basic command-line access (PowerShell, CMD, Terminal)

Verify Python:
```bash
python --version
```

---

## 2) Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/P0GL0L/python-cybersecurity-learning-path.git
cd python-cybersecurity-learning-path
```

---

## 3) Read the Onboarding Rules (Required)

Before writing any code, read:

```
docs/START_HERE.md
```

This explains:
- how stages work
- how to run code
- when you must commit and push

Skipping this causes confusion later.

---

## 4) Begin the Learning Path

Start with **Stage 01**:

```
stage-starters/stage_01
```

Read the stage README and follow it exactly.

Run code using either method:
- from repo root, or
- from inside the stage folder

---

## 5) Stage Completion Rule (Important)

A stage is **not complete** until:

- code runs correctly
- README instructions are followed
- changes are committed
- changes are pushed to GitHub

After completing a stage:
```bash
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Complete Stage XX"
git push
```

Then move to the next stage.

---

## 6) Track Your Progress

Use the checklist:

```
docs/LEARNER_PROGRESS_CHECKLIST.md
```

If an item is not checked, the stage is not done.

---

## 7) Final Integration (Capstone)

After completing all stages:

```
capstone/
```

This is where earlier skills are integrated into a final, review-ready tool.

---

## 8) Choose Documentation Based on Your Goal

When finished, see:

```
audience-docs/
```

- Learners: `learner_overview.md`
- Interviews: `interview_talking_points.md`
- Employers: `employer_README.md`
- Instructors: `instructor_notes.md`

---

## You’re Ready

If you:
- follow stages in order
- commit and push consistently
- use the checklist

This repository will tell a **clear, professional learning story** — even if you are not present to explain it.
