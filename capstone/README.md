# Applied Python: From Fundamentals to Portfolio - Portfolio Repo Template

This repository provides a structured starting point for the staged Python course.

## Quick Start
- Create a new repo in GitHub.
- Copy this template into your repo.
- Complete each stage under `stages/`.
- For Stage 5+, run tests locally and in CI.

## Structure
- `stages/` - one folder per stage project
- `shared/` - shared utilities you may reuse (optional)
- `.github/workflows/` - CI pipeline (Stage 5+)

## Safety
- Do not commit secrets.
- Use `.env.example` and environment variables for API keys.

## License
Add your preferred license (MIT is common for portfolios).
