## Goal

```markdown
## How to Run (Windows)

From the `stage_01` directory, run:

```bash
python app/main.py --help

## Beginner Notes (Windows CMD Shortcut)

If you are new to the command line, you can open CMD directly in the correct folder:

1. Open **File Explorer**
2. Navigate to the folder containing this stage (for example:
   `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\python-cybersecurity-learning-path\stage-starters\stage_01`)
3. Click the address bar at the top
4. Type `cmd` and press **Enter**

A Command Prompt window will open already set to that folder.
You can now run the `python app/main.py` commands without using `cd`.
