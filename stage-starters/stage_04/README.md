# Stage 4 - APIs, Networking Concepts, and Data Integration

## Goal
API Client: pull data from a public API (weather, currency, etc.), cache results, and output a report; Integration mini-project: merge API data with local CSV/JSON

## Acceptance Criteria
- All network calls include timeouts and error handling; No API keys committed to Git

## How to Run
```bash
python app/main.py --help
```
