# Stage 02 - Functions, Data Structures, and Menus

## Goal

Build a menu-driven Python program using reusable functions and basic data structures, with input validation and clean program flow.

This stage reinforces how real CLI tools behave:

- loop until exit
- validate input
- break work into functions
- avoid duplicated code

---

## What You Built

A simple CLI toolkit with these options:

1) Say Hello (asks for a name and validates it)  
2) Temperature Converter (Fahrenheit <-> Celsius)  
3) Exit

---

## Files in This Stage

- `app/main.py` - the full Stage 02 program (menu + features)

---

## How to Run

You can run this stage in two supported ways.

### Option A: Run from the Repository Root (Recommended)

From your repo root folder:

```powershell
python stage-starters\stage_02\app\main.py
```

(macOS / Linux)

```bash
python stage-starters/stage_02/app/main.py
```

---

### Option B: Run from Inside the Stage Folder

If your terminal is already in `stage-starters/stage_02`:

```powershell
python app\main.py
```

(macOS / Linux)

```bash
python app/main.py
```

---

## Definition of Done (Required)

Stage 02 is **only complete** when **all** of the following are true:

1. The program runs without errors
2. Menu options behave as expected
3. Input validation prevents crashes
4. Code is clean, readable, and function-based
5. Changes are **committed and pushed to GitHub**

### Required Git Commands (After Completion)

From the repository root:

```powershell
git status
git add stage-starters/stage_02
git commit -m "Complete Stage 02 - Functions, Data Structures, and Menus"
git push
```

Do **not** proceed to Stage 03 without a clean commit and push.

---

## What’s Next

After completing and committing Stage 02:

- Proceed to `stage-starters/stage_03`
- Continue following the same workflow discipline
- Build toward file handling, logging, and automation
