# Stage 02 — Functions, Data Structures, and Menus

## Goal
Build a menu-driven Python program using reusable functions and basic data structures, with input validation and clean program flow.

This stage reinforces how real CLI tools behave:
- loop until exit
- validate input
- break work into functions
- avoid duplicated code

---

## What You Built
A simple CLI toolkit with these options:
1) Say Hello (asks for a name and validates it)
2) Temperature Converter (Fahrenheit ↔ Celsius)
3) Exit

---

## Files in This Stage
- `app/main.py` — the full Stage 2 program (menu + features)

## How to Run (Windows CMD)

### Option A: Run from the repo root (recommended)
From your repo root folder, run:

```bat
python stage-starters\stage_02\app\main.py
```

### Option B: Run from inside the stage folder

If your terminal is already in stage-starters\stage_02, run:
```bat
python app\main.py
```
