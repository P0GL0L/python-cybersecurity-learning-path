# START HERE (Python Cybersecurity Learning Path)

Welcome. This repository is a step-by-step learning path for **Python + cybersecurity**.  
You will progress from beginner fundamentals to secure software development and a final capstone project.

If you follow the stages in order and type the code yourself, you will build real skills—not just copy/paste results.

---

## What You Need Installed (Windows)

1. **Python 3.10+**
   - Verify: open CMD and run:
     ```bat
     python --version
     ```
2. **VS Code**
3. **Git**
   - Verify: open CMD and run:
     ```bat
     git --version
     ```

---

## What “Open docs/” Means (No Confusion)

- You **read lessons** in VS Code from the `docs/` folder.
- You **run commands** in CMD/PowerShell from the repo folder.
- `docs/` contains **learning material** (Markdown files), not runnable code.

In VS Code:
- Click `docs/`
- Open the stage file
- Follow instructions step-by-step

## How To Use This Repo (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1 — Clone the repo
```bat
git clone https://github.com/P0GL0L/python-cybersecurity-learning-path.git
cd python-cybersecurity-learning-path

### Step 2 — Open the repository in VS Code (THIS IS REQUIRED)

1. Open **VS Code**
2. Click **File** (top-left menu)
3. Click **Open Folder**
4. Select:
5. Click **Select Folder**

You should now see folders on the LEFT side of VS Code.

---

### Step 3 — Understand the folders (VERY IMPORTANT)

You will see these folders:
docs/
stage-starters/
capstone/


They mean different things:

- `docs/` → **READ HERE**
  - Explanations
  - How things work
  - Guidance

- `stage-starters/` → **START CODING HERE**
  - This is where **Stage 1 actually begins**
  - You will open Python files here

- `capstone/` → **DO THIS LAST**
  - Final project after all stages

---

### Step 4 — START STAGE 1 (DO THIS, NOT ANYTHING ELSE)

1. In VS Code (left panel), click the arrow next to `stage-starters`
2. Click the arrow next to `stage1`
3. Click the first Python file you see
4. READ the comments at the top of the file
5. Follow the instructions written in that file
6. Run the file using CMD or the VS Code Run button

❗ You do NOT start in `docs/`  
❗ You do NOT start in `capstone/`

You start in:

---

### Step 5 — Use `docs/` only when told to

When a Stage 1 file says something like:
> “Read the explanation in docs/…”

THEN you open `docs/`.

Otherwise, stay in `stage-starters/`.

---

### Step 6 — Move forward only after finishing Stage 1

Do not open:
- Stage 2
- Capstone

Until Stage 1 is complete.

This order matters.
