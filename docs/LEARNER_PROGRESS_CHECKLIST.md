# Learner Progress Checklist  
Python Cybersecurity Learning Path

This checklist is your **single source of truth** for tracking progress through the learning path.  
A stage is **not complete** until every box in that stage is checked **and** changes are committed and pushed to GitHub.

---

## How to Use This Checklist

- Complete stages **in order**
- Do **not** skip stages
- Treat each stage like a real deliverable
- Commit and push **after every stage**
- Use this checklist to self-audit before moving forward

## Global Requirements (Apply to Every Stage)

Before advancing past any stage, confirm:

- [ ] Code runs without unhandled exceptions
- [ ] Inputs are validated (no crashes on bad input)
- [ ] CLI supports `--help` where applicable
- [ ] README for the stage is complete and accurate
- [ ] Changes are committed to Git
- [ ] Changes are pushed to GitHub
- [ ] `git status` shows a clean working tree

---

## Stage 01 – Foundations and Setup

**Focus:** Python basics, functions, CLI structure, workflow discipline

- [ ] At least 5 small functions implemented
- [ ] Menu-driven program routes to all functions
- [ ] Invalid input handled gracefully
- [ ] Code follows basic formatting and naming standards
- [ ] Program runs from the command line
- [ ] Stage 01 README reviewed and followed
- [ ] Commit message written clearly
- [ ] Stage 01 committed and pushed

---

## Stage 02 – Functions, Data Structures, and Menus

**Focus:** Clean program flow and reusable logic

- [ ] Menu loop runs until explicit exit
- [ ] Functions are reusable and not duplicated
- [ ] Data structures (lists, dicts) used appropriately
- [ ] Input validation prevents crashes
- [ ] CLI runs correctly from repo root and stage folder
- [ ] Stage 02 README complete and accurate
- [ ] Commit and push completed

---

## Stage 03 – Files, Automation, and Robust CLI Programs

**Focus:** File I/O, flags, predictable CLI behavior

- [ ] Supports CLI flags (`--help`, `--input`, `--output`, `--verbose`)
- [ ] Missing files handled cleanly
- [ ] Exit behavior is meaningful (success vs error)
- [ ] File paths work cross-platform
- [ ] Example usage verified
- [ ] Stage 03 README updated and followed
- [ ] Commit and push completed

---

## Stage 04 – APIs, Networking Concepts, and Data Integration

**Focus:** External data, networking discipline, caching

- [ ] API requests include timeouts and error handling
- [ ] No API keys committed to Git
- [ ] Environment variables used for secrets
- [ ] API responses cached with TTL
- [ ] Local data integrated correctly (JSON/CSV)
- [ ] CLI produces a clear report
- [ ] Stage 04 README complete (run, examples, troubleshooting)
- [ ] Commit and push completed

---

## Stage 05 – Testing, Packaging, CI, and Documentation

**Focus:** Reliability, repeatability, professionalism

- [ ] At least 10 meaningful unit tests written
- [ ] External I/O mocked in tests
- [ ] Tests pass locally
- [ ] Project is installable via `pyproject.toml`
- [ ] CI runs on push and pull requests
- [ ] README includes install, usage, examples, troubleshooting
- [ ] `.pytest_cache` is ignored and not tracked
- [ ] Commit and push completed

---

## Stage 06 – Portfolio CLI Project (OpsOps)

**Focus:** End-to-end, portfolio-ready deliverable

- [ ] CLI tool installs and runs successfully
- [ ] Commands behave predictably (`run`, `demo`, etc.)
- [ ] Input data processed correctly
- [ ] Output reports are clear and useful
- [ ] Tests pass locally
- [ ] Package installs in editable mode
- [ ] Documentation is complete and professional
- [ ] Stage 06 committed and pushed

---
